# Machine Learning Coursework From Andrew Ng's Coursea Course
MATLAB and Python solutions to the problem sets in [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). For MATLAB, solutions are submitted via the .mlx files from the Coursera course for use. For Python, assignments are obtained and graded via the following excellent GitHub repository: https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments

My progress throught this course is ongoing.
